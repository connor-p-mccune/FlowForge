# FlowForge CLI

Trigger and watch [FlowForge](../README.md) workflow runs from the terminal —
a thin, **zero-dependency** client for the [public API](../docs/API.md),
built for CI pipelines and quick ops work.

```
$ flowforge trigger 6f0c… --data '{"orderId": 42}' --watch
Run e57a… pending
Poll: /api/v1/executions/e57a…
  succeeded  t1 (trigger-manual)
  succeeded  h1 (action-http) 1.2s
  succeeded  log1 (output-log)
Run completed in 4.0s
```

The process exits `0` only when the run completed — a failed workflow fails
the CI job that triggered it.

## Install

```bash
cd cli && npm link      # puts `flowforge` on your PATH
```

## Authenticate

Mint a token in **Settings → API tokens** (scopes: `trigger`, `read`), then
either:

```bash
# Interactive — verifies the token, then saves ~/.flowforge.json (0600)
flowforge login --url https://your-flowforge-host --token ffp_…

# CI — env vars always win over the file; no login step needed
export FLOWFORGE_URL=https://your-flowforge-host
export FLOWFORGE_TOKEN=ffp_…
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `flowforge workflows` | List workflows visible to the token (the ID column is what `trigger` takes) |
| `flowforge trigger <id> [--data <json>] [--key <k>] [--watch]` | Start a run; `--key` sets an [`Idempotency-Key`](../docs/API.md#trigger-a-workflow) so retries are safe |
| `flowforge runs <id> [--limit N]` | A workflow's recent runs |
| `flowforge insights <id> [--limit N]` | Duration percentiles, success rate, throughput, and anomalous runs ([docs](../docs/INSIGHTS.md)) |
| `flowforge forecast <id>` | Predicted next-run duration and bottleneck ([docs](../docs/INSIGHTS.md#forecasting-the-next-run)) |
| `flowforge run <exec-id> [--watch]` | One run with its steps |
| `flowforge cancel <exec-id>` | Stop a queued or running run (cooperative) |
| `flowforge resume <exec-id> [--watch]` | Continue a failed/cancelled run — succeeded steps are reused, only the failed part re-runs |
| `flowforge approvals [--status pending]` | Runs waiting on a human, across your workspaces |
| `flowforge approve <id> [--note "…"]` | Wave a paused run through its approval gate (needs the `approve` scope) |
| `flowforge reject <id> [--note "…"]` | Send it down the rejected branch instead |

`--watch` polls every 2 seconds (`--interval <seconds>` to change) and prints
each step transition once. `NO_COLOR=1` (or piping stdout) disables colors.

## A CI job in three lines

```yaml
- run: npx --prefix cli flowforge trigger $WORKFLOW_ID --key "$GITHUB_RUN_ID" --watch
  env:
    FLOWFORGE_URL: ${{ vars.FLOWFORGE_URL }}
    FLOWFORGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLOWFORGE_TOKEN }}
```

Using the CI run id as the idempotency key means a re-run of the job can
never double-trigger the workflow.

## Development

```bash
npm test    # node:test against a stub API server — no FlowForge needed
```
